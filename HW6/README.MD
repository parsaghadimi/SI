1. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning: 
- Key concepts like Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward, and Policy are briefly explained. 

2. Implementing Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: 
- implementing two reinforcement learning algorithms = Q-Learning and SARSA. 

3. Using the Frozen Lake Environment: 
- The Frozen Lake environment from the Gymnasium (gym) library is used as the test environment. 
- Details about the environment, such as the grid size, slipperiness, and the goal of reaching the target cell, are provided. 

4. Implementing a Random Agent: 
- comparing the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithms with a random agent that selects actions randomly. 

5. Implementing Q-Learning: 
- The implementation details of the Q-Learning algorithm are discussed. 

6. Implementing SARSA: 
- The implementation details of the SARSA algorithm are discussed. 

7. Comparing the Performance of Q-Learning and SARSA
