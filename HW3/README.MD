1. Similarity measures for clustering: 
- Euclidean distance 
- Density-reachable (related to DBSCAN algorithm) 
- Jaccard similarity 
- Cosine similarity 

2. Constructing a dissimilarity matrix: 
- Handling mixed data types (nominal, ordinal, numeric) 
- Selecting appropriate similarity/dissimilarity measures for the data 
- Converting the dissimilarity matrix to a similarity matrix 

3. Clustering algorithms (theory): 
- The general concept of clustering algorithms 

4. Clustering algorithms (implementation): 
- Implementing clustering algorithms
