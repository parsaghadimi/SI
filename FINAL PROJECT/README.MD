1. Image generation using neural networks: 
- Using GAN
- Training a 3-layer neural network with 200 neurons on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
- Generating an image by using white noise as input, setting one of the output neurons to 1 and the rest to 0. 
- Calculating the gradient with respect to the input and updating the input values iteratively to generate the desired image. 
- Exploring the concept of generative neural networks. 

2. Semantic text analysis and automatic text classification: 
- Applying machine learning algorithms, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP), for the task of automatic text classification.
