1. Neural Networks - Theory: 
a. Regression: 
- Understanding how to design a neural network equivalent to linear regression using the signed sigmoid (S) and linear (L) activation functions. 
b. Binary Classification: 
- Designing a neural network for binary classification, using the S and L activation functions in the hidden and output layers. 
- Deriving the final decision boundary based on the network parameters. 
c. Neural Network Architecture: 
- Investigating the possibility of designing an equivalent neural network without a hidden layer. 

2. Multi-Layer Networks: 
a. Implementing logical operations (NAND, NOR) using Perceptrons. 
b. Designing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to determine whether three given real numbers are "well-ordered" or not. 

3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): 
a. Understanding the theory and implementation of convolutional neural networks.
b. Using cifar10 dataset
c. Implementation of transfer learning
d. Implementing batch normalization
